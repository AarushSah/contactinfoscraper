# Web Scraper for Contact Information
This is a Python script that uses the BeautifulSoup library to scrape contact information from a website page and store it in a CSV file. The script extracts email addresses, phone numbers, first names, and last names from the website page, and saves them in a structured format that can be easily analyzed or imported into other applications.

To use this script, simply specify the URL of the website page you want to scrape, and run the script in a Python environment with the required libraries installed. The script will automatically access the website page, extract the relevant contact information, and save it to a CSV file named "contacts.csv" in the current working directory.

Note that web scraping can be a complex and sensitive task that may be subject to legal and ethical considerations. It's important to respect the website's terms of service and robots.txt file, and to handle any errors or exceptions that may occur during the scraping process.

Please use this script responsibly and at your own risk. Feel free to fork or modify this repository to suit your own needs, and to contribute to the open-source community.
